/*
// Explanation for Approach: 3 
- Create an Array of size 26 and fill with all 0's
- Iterate all the elements of given sentence and mark the character present in our array
- Eg: if we are at character 'g', ASCII value of g = 103. So we substract ASCII value of 'a'(97) from 'g' to get 
  the correct index of 'g' in our Array
- So, now it would be 103-97 = 6. So 6 is the index of 'g'. So now at index 6 we increase the frequency to 1.
- Also we can verify that 6 is the position of 'g' in alphabetical sequence (0 based indexing)
- Now, fill the positions in the Array as 1 if the corresponding character is present in the sentence
- Now, we can find the sum of all the elements in the Array. If all the characters are present in the 
  sentence, then the vector sum will be equal to 26. so we return true. else we return false
  If any english character is not present in the sentence, then that character's index in the array will be 0. 
  So sum won't be 26. so it'll return false
