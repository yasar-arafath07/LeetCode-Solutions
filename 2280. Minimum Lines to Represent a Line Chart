/*
// EXPLANATION:
- Prerequisite required here: Slope of a line.
- So, to find out the Slope of the below line, 

     (x1,y1)-------------------------------(x2,y2)

-The Slope of the above line is: Slope = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)

- So, Basically if the slope of 2 different lines are not equal, we need a new line. So, we increment count.
- So, we will check if the slope of 3 points at a time are equal or not
  Consider the 3 points (x1,y1), (x2,y2) and (x3,y3)
  Let's represent them in the line as:

  (x1,y1)-------------------------(x2,y2)-----------------------(x3,y3)

- So, if the point (x3,y3) lies on the above line, then Slope of (x1,y1) & (x2,y2) will be same as (x3,y3) & (x1,y1)
i.e, (y3-y1)/(x3-x1) = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) OR (y3-y2)/(x3-x2) = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)
So, By Cross multiplying, we get: (y3-y1)*(x2-x1) = (y2-y1)*(x3-x1) OR (y3-y2)*(x2-x1) = (y2-y1)*(x3-x2)
- So, if the slopes are not equal, we need a new line to represent. So, count++.
